# Music Generator Project

## Quick (Irrelevant) Note 

This project is an attempt to experiment with github, better understand the jargon (all those pulls, fetchs, repos and commits get confusion you know?), and how to implement version control.
I also wanna experiment a bit about the read me files, hence why this read me file is kinda structured terribly.

## Purpose

To create a music generator for sight reading exercise purpose.
The end goal of the project is to implement machine learning to generate simple musical exercises.

## Where Abouts Are We?

On earth... oh for the project!
So far the project is only at the point of randomly generating music. Using random generators we can format the code to be structured for an application called Lilypond.

Lilypond - A music engraving program that takes in a file and converts it to display sheet music.

## Whats Next?

Currently refactoring the code to break down the current god class and reduce coupling. 
This should allow us to scale the project beyong Lilypond and try different music engraving applications that accept other standards.
